TODO, GREG CAVE:
* Set Greg intro text to say "Congratulations!  This quest is already complete!" if complete
* Set Greg cave to show "quest complete" and return user to start screen instead of ending game
* Set main NPC text to know which quests are complete/incomplete at start of level
* Set health to decline after wrong guess

IDEAS:
* LEVEL: combat-related and math skill
* Saving/retrieving game state to localstorage and/or server.  Pretty important.  :)
* Figure out a way of displaying quests completed in the HUD
* Add another type of tile that allows a puzzle object to "click" into place.
  (i.e. if acceleration < 2, pull it to a stop.)
* Set up a puzzle tile and puzzle object to clear a stage when joined.
* Random multiple-choice problem generation: have NPCs generate questions,
  and have tile answer choices created

DONE!
* Add an NPC that informs user of the quest (select all odd numbers!)
* Add a "quest clear" event that triggers when all odd tiles have been walked over.
* Reset tile type done
* Build tile set all the way up to 99 white and 99 black
* Add a "reset" tile in tileset
* Build a map with number tiles that are simple walk-overs.
* Build a map with number tiles that toggle on and off.
* Collisions with map level objects (rocks, etc.) now work.
* Make Puzzleblock smaller (now using the chest icon)
* Make Puzzleblock move in the direction that player moves on collision.
  (Kinda works -- but not quite as expected.)
* Add an object of type Puzzleblock to a map.
* Add a routine to Puzzleblock to have it move in response to collisions.
