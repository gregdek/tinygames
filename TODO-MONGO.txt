TODO:
* Build tile set all the way up to 99 white and 99 black
  + 0-99: various tiles
  + 100-199: white
  + 200-299: black
* Set up "reset" tile (tile 29) with behaviors:
  + If "good", give quest clear message and create key
  + If "bad", reset all
* Add a "quest clear" event that triggers when all odd tiles have been walked over.  (How best to do this?)
* Add an NPC that informs user of the quest (select all odd numbers!)

IDEAS:
* Add another type of tile that allows a puzzle object to "click" into place.
  (i.e. if acceleration < 2, pull it to a stop.)
* Set up a puzzle tile and puzzle object to clear a stage when joined.
* Random multiple-choice problem generation: have NPCs generate questions,
  and have tile answer choices created

DONE!
* Add a "reset" tile in tileset
* Build a map with number tiles that are simple walk-overs.
* Build a map with number tiles that toggle on and off.
* Collisions with map level objects (rocks, etc.) now work.
* Make Puzzleblock smaller (now using the chest icon)
* Make Puzzleblock move in the direction that player moves on collision.
  (Kinda works -- but not quite as expected.)
* Add an object of type Puzzleblock to a map.
* Add a routine to Puzzleblock to have it move in response to collisions.
