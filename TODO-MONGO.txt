TODO:
* fix bug dealing with radio buttons and index vs. value
  + the only time we care about getting value by reference is when
    we reach the "firing" procedure.  Which is pulling raw value,
    but should really be pulling the array index of the value...
    but what's the syntax to describe that?  
      + Find the place in toys.js called when weapon is fired
      + Make an exact duplicate of that call and tinker
* build out a full quest for the factor game!
  + add swords and arrows to the list of gettable items
  + figure out how old man gives sword 
* Q3: Figure out how to ditch "quest clear" message after oldman talks
* general: change NPC text for Village
* general: put "=" into the font (appears to be missing)
* general: Set main NPC text to know which quests are complete/incomplete at start of level
* gregcave: Set health to decline after wrong guess?
* general: illustrate how to change what NPC can say in the middle of a level
* customize monster class to display different enemy sprite depending on health?  or no?
* Get common core math skill listing into the git repo as a separate "TODO"

IDEAS:

* Start up mongo-devel list?
* Add map functionality
* Saving/retrieving game state to localstorage and/or server.  Pretty important.  :)
* Figure out a way of displaying quests completed in the HUD
* Add more useful items, and add shops to buy them (just copy Zelda?)
* Add another type of tile that allows a puzzle object to "click" into place.
  (i.e. if acceleration < 2, pull it to a stop.)
* Set up a puzzle tile and puzzle object to clear a stage when joined.
* Random multiple-choice problem generation: have NPCs generate questions,
  and have tile answer choices created

DONE!
* Fixed tricky bug re: calling weapons in HUD by id (wrong) instead of reference (right)
* Q3: set it so the key is only given once and the doors stay opened once open
* keys figured out
* new graphics for weapons: 5, 7
* new graphics for weapons: 2, 3
* showing new weapons in the HUD
* Customized enemy instantiation to accept new params: health and speed
* Added visible hit points to "octo" enemy class upon strike
* gregdek-3: add new basic cave with enemies
* gregdek-2: Add a new quest for multiples of 5 and 3
* gregcave: Rename files from "math00n" to something more extensible
* gregcave: Set Greg cave to show "quest complete" and return user to start screen instead of ending game
* gregcave: Fix bug for "no steps if in and out"
* gregcave: Set player to come out of cave in the right place
* Set Greg intro text to say "This quest is already complete!" if complete
* Add an NPC that informs user of the quest (select all odd numbers!)
* Add a "quest clear" event that triggers when all odd tiles have been walked over.
* Reset tile type done
* Build tile set all the way up to 99 white and 99 black
* Add a "reset" tile in tileset
* Build a map with number tiles that are simple walk-overs.
* Build a map with number tiles that toggle on and off.
* Collisions with map level objects (rocks, etc.) now work.
* Make Puzzleblock smaller (now using the chest icon)
* Make Puzzleblock move in the direction that player moves on collision.
  (Kinda works -- but not quite as expected.)
* Add an object of type Puzzleblock to a map.
* Add a routine to Puzzleblock to have it move in response to collisions.
