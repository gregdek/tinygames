TODO:
* general: Set main NPC text to know which quests are complete/incomplete at start of level
* gregcave: Set health to decline after wrong guess?
* general: illustrate how to change what NPC can say in the middle of a level
* customize monster class to display different enemy sprite depending on health?  or no?

IDEAS:
* Figure out how to add combat in a meaningful way.
  + Here's an idea.  Have weapons that are factors, and monsters that are multiples of those
    factors!  Want to kill a 15 monster?  Better find the 3 sword and the 5 sword!  Oh, I am
    liking that idea!  And your total points = the total monster value you've killed.
* Saving/retrieving game state to localstorage and/or server.  Pretty important.  :)
* Figure out a way of displaying quests completed in the HUD
* Add another type of tile that allows a puzzle object to "click" into place.
  (i.e. if acceleration < 2, pull it to a stop.)
* Set up a puzzle tile and puzzle object to clear a stage when joined.
* Random multiple-choice problem generation: have NPCs generate questions,
  and have tile answer choices created

DONE!
* new graphics for weapons: 5, 7
* new graphics for weapons: 2, 3
* showing new weapons in the HUD
* Customized enemy instantiation to accept new params: health and speed
* Added visible hit points to "octo" enemy class upon strike
* gregdek-3: add new basic cave with enemies
* gregdek-2: Add a new quest for multiples of 5 and 3
* gregcave: Rename files from "math00n" to something more extensible
* gregcave: Set Greg cave to show "quest complete" and return user to start screen instead of ending game
* gregcave: Fix bug for "no steps if in and out"
* gregcave: Set player to come out of cave in the right place
* Set Greg intro text to say "This quest is already complete!" if complete
* Add an NPC that informs user of the quest (select all odd numbers!)
* Add a "quest clear" event that triggers when all odd tiles have been walked over.
* Reset tile type done
* Build tile set all the way up to 99 white and 99 black
* Add a "reset" tile in tileset
* Build a map with number tiles that are simple walk-overs.
* Build a map with number tiles that toggle on and off.
* Collisions with map level objects (rocks, etc.) now work.
* Make Puzzleblock smaller (now using the chest icon)
* Make Puzzleblock move in the direction that player moves on collision.
  (Kinda works -- but not quite as expected.)
* Add an object of type Puzzleblock to a map.
* Add a routine to Puzzleblock to have it move in response to collisions.
